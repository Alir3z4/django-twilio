Foreword

Read this before you get started with django-twilio. This will hopefully answer
some questions about the purpose of the project, and why you should (or
shouldn't) be using it.

Purpose
=======

Building telephony applications has always been something of a complex and time
consuming task for developers. With `twilio <http://www.twilio.com/>`_'s entry
into the telephony world, developers were able to build large scale telephony
applications for the first time, without the massive learning curve associated
with traditional telephony development.

While twilio's APIs allow you to build powerful voice & sms apps in your
favorite programming language, it can still be quite difficult and time
consuming to roll out your own telephony apps for your Django-powered website.

django-twilio's core purpose is to abstract away as much telephony knowledge as
possible, so that you can focus on the functionality and logic of your
telephony app, and have it seamlessly integrate into your website without
confusion.
